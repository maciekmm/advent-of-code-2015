Day 4:
======
- Language chosen: [go](https://golang.org)
- Description: http://pastebin.com/3c2xTCqi
- Input: `yzbqklnj`

## Tasks:

1./2. I've written a single app to solve both tasks. As the task itself is pretty cpu intensive I've decided to multithread the solution (golang rocks here).

## Execution

You can use http://play.golang.org/p/HfZRTxw6pQ to test the solution (only for 5 zeros as it takes too long for playground to handle it)

or compile and run locally.

```
go build
./day-4
yzbqklnj
000000
```
