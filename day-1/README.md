##Tasks:
1. For the first part I've decided to not write any app as the solution was as easy as using ctrl+f in your browser for both paranthesis and subtracting occurance number.
2. For the second part I've written a small (and my first) brainfuck script (code in basement.bf) took me almost an hour to do it. To run the code I've used 16bit cells and for printing out number I've used code found on the [wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms#Print_value_of_cell_x_as_number_for_ANY_sized_cell_.28ie_8bit.2C_16bit.2C_etc.29).
