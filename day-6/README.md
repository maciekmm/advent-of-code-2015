- Description: http://pastebin.com/CabW80jv
- Input: http://pastebin.com/LVg5eqCf

## Tasks:

1/2. Both tasks were pretty easy. I've chosen language I've never coded in: fortran. Struggling a little it took me around 40 minutes to get this to work. Pretty cool experience. Probably made a lot of mistakes, correct me if you want :>
